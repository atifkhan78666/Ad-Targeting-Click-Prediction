**Ad Click Prediction using Machine Learning**

**Introduction**
This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on demographic and behavioral data. In the era of digital marketing, understanding user engagement is essential for optimizing ad strategies and improving conversion rates. By leveraging data visualization, preprocessing, and logistic regression, this project aims to identify the key factors influencing ad engagement and assist marketers in making data-driven decisions.

**Objectives**
Predict the likelihood of a user clicking on an advertisement using machine learning.
Explore the relationships between variables such as age, area income, and internet usage.
Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Dataset**
**The dataset includes the following features:**
Daily Time Spent on Site
Age
Area Income
Daily Internet Usage
Ad Topic Line
City
Country
Timestamp
Clicked on Ad (Target variable)

**Workflow**
Data Exploration and Visualization
Examining feature distributions and relationships
Using boxplots, correlation heatmaps, and bar charts

**Data Preprocessing**
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling and data cleaning

**Model Development**
Logistic Regression for binary classification

**Model Evaluation**
Confusion matrix and classification report analysis

**Key Insights**
Older users showed a higher likelihood of clicking on ads.
Users from lower-income regions demonstrated greater engagement.
Demographic factors such as age, income, and location significantly influenced ad performance.
These findings can support the creation of targeted marketing strategies and more effective ad placements.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn


**Results**
The logistic regression model achieved satisfactory accuracy and balanced performance across precision and recall, demonstrating its reliability in predicting ad engagement patterns.
